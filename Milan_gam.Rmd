This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
milan_full <- read.csv("milan_full.csv")
milan_full <- na.omit(milan_full)
require(mgcv)
infections.gam <- gam(LAGRR ~ s(Humidity) + s(Temperature) + s(pm25) + s(pm10) + s(no) + s(o3), family=gaussian(link="log"), data=milan_full)
```

```{r}
plot(infections.gam, ylim=c(-1,1),scale=0,se=2, residuals=TRUE, shade=TRUE,pages=1)
summary(infections.gam)
```
