This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
wuhan_full <- read.csv("wuhan_full3_cut.csv")
wuhan_full <- na.omit(wuhan_full)
require(mgcv)
infections.gam <- glm(DailyLag ~ (Humidity) + (Temperature) + (pm25) + (pm10) + (no2) + (o3) + (so2) + (co), family=poisson, data=wuhan_full)
```

```{r}
plot(infections.gam)
summary(infections.gam)
```
```{r}
for (i in 2:9) {
CI_lower <- coefficients(infections.gam)[i] - 1.96*summary(infections.gam)$coefficients[i,2]
CI_upper <- coefficients(infections.gam)[i] + 1.96*summary(infections.gam)$coefficients[i,2]
print(exp(CI_upper))
print(exp(CI_lower))
}

```
