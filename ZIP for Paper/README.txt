Data Folder: 
	Each city file contains daily case numbers (source), median temperature, median humidity (source), PM2.5, O3, NO2 counts (AQICN), as well as mobility data in the categories retail, grocery shopping, park attendance, transit, work, and home (Google), infections (??), Rt (rt.live) (we need to delete rt2 I don't think we used that?), and the state the city is in. The data are arranged by date from x to y (we need to delete whatever range we didn't use).

All25ItalyGAM provides all code for the calculations in the paper (?? does it have everythign)
